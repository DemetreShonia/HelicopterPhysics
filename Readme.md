## Helicopter Simulation Project 🚁
I took an excellent course from Indie Pixel on udemy to learn Unity Physics in depth and develop a helicopter controller. I am coding along with him to elevate my skills 💓🤟
This repository contains the code and resources for the Helicopter Game developed as part of Indie Pixel's Udemy course on 3D physics.

## 📷 Overview

The project showcases essential concepts in 3D physics, focusing on helicopter flight mechanics and realistic movement simulation. It features engine scripts that simulate real helicopter physics, including horsepower and other dynamics, all implemented in C# with a well-structured code architecture.

## 📐 Features
- Realistic helicopter controls
- 3D physics simulation
- Customizable flight dynamics
- Interactive environment
